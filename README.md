# TechSmart-3D-Cube
Good Evening good friends! I've finally completed (after many months) my research on 3D Graphics Theory! I'm now able to showcase a basic 3D Cube with layered-face ordering! Enjoy! I greatly thank all of the kind users on Stack Overflow (and the help of previously asked questions) to help aid me in getting to this point!

Controls: WASD - Move Camera | Q - Fly Up | E - Fly Down | Mouse Cursor - Look Around | Escape - End Demo

I'm currently working on custom 3D Modeling Software to make production of projects and games easier and faster!
