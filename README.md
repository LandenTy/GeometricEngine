# Geometric Engine - 3D Engine Demo

Welcome to the **Geometric Engine**! After months of research and development, Iâ€™m thrilled to present the first version of my 3D engine. The engine currently supports a basic 3D Cube, featuring layered face ordering and a fully interactive camera system. This engine is a work-in-progress, but it already provides a great foundation for expanding to more complex 3D objects, scene management, and materials.

Special thanks to all the amazing Stack Overflow users whose answers guided me during the development process!

### Demo Features
- **Camera Controls**: Move, Rotate, Fly (Up/Down)
- **Reset Scene**: Instantly reset the scene
- **Interactive Cube**: Showcase of a basic 3D cube with layered-face ordering

### Controls
- **WASD** - Move Camera
- **Q** - Fly Up
- **E** - Fly Down
- **Mouse Cursor** - Look Around
- **R** - Reset Scene
- **Escape** - End Demo

**Hello! Welcome to the Geometric Engine!**

_This Tutorial will help you get an insight on getting started with a project in the Geometric Engine!_

**Chapter 0 : Base Vocabulary**

Before we get started on learning how everything works, it's important you know what each individual thing is used for
so you can increase your productivity throughout the Engine!

       ~ Delta Time - Helps keep a consistant time frame, whilst updating the screen
       ~ Entities ~ Fancy way of saying an object

**Chapter 1 : Camera Controller**

The base camera controller comes with 4 (user-allowed) functions:
            
            - Move
            - Rotate
            - Mouse_Controller
            - Reset

**Chapter 1.1 : The Move Function**

The `Move` function as the name states, is responsible for handling player-movement.

It takes in 4 parameters:

```
def Move(self, dt, key, flyCam=False):
```
Parameter Breakdown:

  dt - _DeltaTime_
  
  key - _reference to `var_name = pygame.get_pressed()`_ ([Learn More](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed))
  
  flyCam - _(boolean) Enables/Disables cam fly controller_

```
while (1):
    key = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    dt = clock.tick(30) / 1000
    
    # Player Movement
    cam.Move(dt, key, False)
```
__________________________________________
**Chapter 1.2 : The Rotate Function**

The `Rotate` function allows the player to rotate the Camera when pressing the Arrow Keys.

This function takes in 3 Parameters:

```
def Rotate(self, dt, key):
```

Parameter Breakdown:
   
   dt - _Delta Time_
   
   key - _reference to `var_name = pygame.get_pressed()`_ ([Learn More](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed))

```
while (1):
    key = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    dt = clock.tick(30) / 1000
    
    # Player Movement
    cam.Rotate(dt, key, False)
```
__________________________________________
**Chapter 1.3 : The Reset Function**

The `Rotate` function allows the player to rotate the Camera when pressing the Arrow Keys.

This function takes in 3 Parameters:

```
def Reset(self, key):
```

Parameter Breakdown:

   key - _reference to `var_name = pygame.get_pressed()`_ ([Learn More](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed))

```
while (1):
    key = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    
    # Reset Player Controller
    cam.Reset(key)
```
__________________________________________
**CHAPTER 2 : Materials**

Materials are used in the colors and/or texturing of objects. Applying images to your objects is still being worked on,
but when it's finished we assume it'll look a little something like:

```
def apply_texture(self,src):
```
We estimate we'll use this function, and blit the texture onto the polygon scaling the image based on the player's rotation.
This should (in theory) work because since the newest version of the TechSmart Image M-porter (TIM), the objects are applied to
a _pygame.Surface([w,h])_ instance.
__________________________________________
**Chapter 3 : Scenes**

Scenes, like in a play. Are a blank canvas, you can create new scenes by calling the `CreateScene` function within the Camera Class.

```
def CreateScene((w,h)):
```

Parameter Breakdown:
       w - Scene Width
       h - Scene Height

Scenes are extremely useful for things like:
    - Switching between menus
    
    - Switching between levels
    
    - etc
